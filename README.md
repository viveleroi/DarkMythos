# DarkMythos

Maybe the ancient gods weren't myths after all?

Items, both dark and light, have been scattered among the overworld after a clash of the gods.

From dark crystals to magic scrolls, you have a chance to wield what gods did.

But beware - they may be cursed. The more powerful the scroll, the more dangerous the curse may be.

## Scrolls

**Scroll of Botanic Maturity**

Grows plants like bonemeal. Drops from Skeletons. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9.

**Scroll of Iron Touch**

Turns coal ore/blocks into iron. Drops from Zombies. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9 ores/1 block.

**Scroll of Transmootation**

Turns cows into mooshroom or vice-versa. Drops rarely from cows or mooshrooms. If used incorrectly, applies minor hunger curse. Max uses: 1.

## Blocks

### Dark Crystal Ore

Dark Crystal Ore appears in the overworld below level 20 and drops dark crystals when mined with a diamond pickaxe.

### Dark Stone

Dark Stone appears in the overworld between levels 30 and 70.

### Light Crystal Ore

Light Crystal Ore appears in the overworld above level 100 and drops light crystals when mined with a diamond pickaxe. It emits a very small amount of light.

### Light Stone

Light Stone appears in the overworld between levels 100 and above. It emits a very small amount of light.

## Items

### Alpha Pearl

Dropped by the ender dragon.

### Dark Crystals

The base crystals dropped from Dark Crystal Ore.

### Superior Dark Crystals

Add 4 dark crystals around an emerald (top, right, bottom, left) to make a superior dark crystal.

### Legendary Dark Crystals

Add 4 superior dark crystals around a nether star (top, right, bottom, left) to make a legendary dark crystal.

### Mythical Dark Crystals

Use 8 legendary dark crystals surrounding an alpha pearl. Alpha pearl is not consumed.

### Dark Stone Rod

Two dark stone blocks, one above the other. Similar to planks used for sticks. Makes 4.

### Reinforced Dark Stone Rod

Made with one dark stone rod, a diamond, and an obsidian block in any shape.

## Tools

Crystals currently can be used for tools:

- Axe
- Pickaxe
- Shovel
- Sword

### Superior Dark Crystal Tools

Use superior dark crystals and dark stone rods in the same patterns vanilla uses.

### Legendary Dark Crystal Tools

Use legendary dark crystals and reinforced dark stone rods in the same patterns vanilla uses.

(Only sword implemented.)

## Liquids

### Divine Water

Created by dropping a light crystal (will change) into a 1x1 block of water. Can be placed in-world with a bucket.

## Scroll Purification

Scrolls can be dropped into divine water to "purify" them. Pure scrolls have had any curses removed and may be used safely.

## Future

This mod is currently in development, with plans to add/finish:

- Many more scrolls
- Armor recipes for superior dark crystals
- All legendary/mythical crystal variants of tools/armor pieces
- Light items
