# DarkMythos

Maybe the ancient gods weren't myths after all?

Items, both dark and light, have been scattered among the overworld after a clash of the gods.

From dark crystals to magic scrolls, you have a chance to wield what gods did.

But beware - they may be cursed. The more powerful the scroll, the more dangerous the curse may be.

## Scrolls

**Scroll of Botanic Maturity**

Grows plants like bonemeal. Drops from Skeletons. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9.

**Scroll of Iron Touch**

Turns coal ore/blocks into iron. Drops from Zombies. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9 ores/1 block.

**Scroll of Transmootation**

Turns cows into mooshroom or vice-versa. Drops rarely from cows or mooshrooms. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 1.

## Blocks

### Dark Crystal Ore

Dark Crystal Ore appears in the overworld below level 20 and drops dark crystals when mined with a diamond pickaxe.

### Dark Stone

Dark Stone appears in the overworld between levels 30 and 70.

## Items

### Dark Crystals

The base crystals dropped from Dark Crystal Ore.

### Superior Dark Crystals

Add 4 dark crystals around an emerald (top, right, bottom, left) to make a superior dark crystal.

### Legendary Dark Crystals

Add 4 superior dark crystals around a nether star (top, right, bottom, left) to make a legendary dark crystal.

### Dark Stone Rod

Two dark stone blocks, one above the other. Similar to planks used for sticks. Makes 4.

### Reinforced Dark Stone Rod

Made with one dark stone rod, a diamond, and an obsidian block in any shape.

## Tools

- Axe
- Pickaxe

### Superior Dark Crystal Tools

Use superior dark crystals and dark stone rods in the same patterns vanilla uses.

### Legendary Dark Crystal Tools
