# DarkMythos

Maybe the ancient gods weren't myths after all?

Resources, both dark and light, have been scattered among the overworld after a clash of the gods.

From dark and light crystals to magic scrolls, you have a chance to wield what gods did.

But beware - they may be cursed. The more powerful the scroll, the more dangerous the curse may be.

Eventually you'll be able to make divine water and cleanse the cursed scrolls.

## Scrolls

**Scroll of Botanic Maturity**

Grows plants like bonemeal. Drops from Skeletons. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9.

**Scroll of Iron Touch**

Turns coal ore/blocks into iron. Drops from Zombies. If used incorrectly, applies minor poison curse. Max uses: 9 ores/1 block.

**Scroll of Transmootation**

Turns cows into mooshroom or vice-versa. Drops rarely from cows or mooshrooms. If used incorrectly, applies minor hunger curse. Max uses: 1.

## Progression

Most scrolls are obtainable/usable at any point.

Tools, weapons, and armor items require different tier crystals. Higher tiers are more powerful and worth obtaining.

Superior items are available as soon as you have enough dark crystals and emeralds.

Legendary items will require nether stars.

Mythical items will require killing the ender dragon.

Divine water (for purifying scrolls) will require mythical items.

## Blocks

**Dark Crystal Ore**

Dark Crystal Ore appears in the overworld below level 20 and drops dark crystals when mined with a diamond pickaxe.

**Dark Stone**

Dark Stone appears in the overworld between levels 30 and 70.

**Light Crystal Ore**

Light Crystal Ore appears in the overworld above level 100 and drops light crystals when mined with a diamond pickaxe. It emits a very small amount of light.

**Light Stone**

Light Stone appears in the overworld between levels 100 and above. It emits a very small amount of light.

Made with one dark stone rod, a diamond, and an obsidian block in any shape.

## Liquids
